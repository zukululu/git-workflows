# Feature Branch

This is a guided exercise for a pair of students, walking through how to create an use feature branches. Within your pair, decide who should play the role of **Student 1** and **Student 2**.

## Setup
To get started, Student 1 should fork this repository to their own account and add Student 2 as a collaborator.

To add someone as a collaborator, go to the "Settings" tab on the GitHub page for the repository and then navigate to the "Collaborators & teams" menu item. Student 2 will receive an email with a confirmation link.

Once Student 2 has been added as a collaborator, both Student 1 and Student 2 should clone the repository from Student 1's fork.

## Feature Branches

Feature branches are useful for - you guessed it - building out a feature in isolation. Work on one feature branch won't affect work on another and they can be merged back in to master when ready.

This application is a simple website built with React. Both students will be creating a feature branch, building out a new component on their feature branch then pushing their feature branch to GitHub and creating a pull request.

**Student 1**

Create a feature branch called `home-page`. Inside of `Home.js` build out a simple component called `<Home>` that renders an `<h1>` with "Home" in it.

**Student 2**

Create a feature branch called `about-page`. Inside of `About.js`, build out a simple component called `<About>` that renders an `<h1>` with "About" in it.

**Both Students**
Add and commit your changes. Then push them up to the remote version of your feature branch (`git push origin <branch_name>`). On GitHub, make a pull request from your branch for your changes to be merged in.

Student 1 should merge Student 2's pull request and vice versa. If there are merge conflicts, go a head and resolve them.

**Both Students**
Check out `master` and pull the latest changes. You should have both the `<Home>` and `<About>` components now.
